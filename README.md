# React + Vite + Express template

## Goals

Goal of this repo is to create a simple template to create apps with React, Vite and Express

## Initial setup

To initiate this template all you need to do is to type

```batch
npm install
```
in your terminall.

## Commands

To run the code you need to type

```batch
npm run watch
```

which will create **/dist** directory and watch for any changes on the react app. You can also use

```batch
npm run buid
```
but it will not watch for changes.

After that you need to open another termial window and type

```batch
npm run server
```

to start the server (*note: changes on the server require terminating server and restarting it*). After that you just need to open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app running!
